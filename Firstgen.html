        <h1>First Generation College Student</h1>
        <p>
            At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a 4-year college or university degree.
            This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.) who have completed a four-year degree.
